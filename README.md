# 🌾 AgriTrust – Blockchain-Based Agricultural Traceability System

> **⚠️ Status: Code Migration in Progress**
> This project is currently being migrated from a private development repository for public release. The full source code, smart contracts, and documentation are undergoing a final cleanup and will be pushed here by **January 12, 2026**.

## 📖 Overview
**AgriTrust** is a decentralized application (DApp) designed to bring transparency and trust to the agricultural supply chain. By leveraging the **Ethereum Blockchain**, it eliminates the "black box" of food sourcing, ensuring that end consumers can verify the origin, quality, and journey of their produce.

This project was selected as a **Finalist in the Smart India Hackathon (SIH) 2025**.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **Immutable Record Keeping:** All transaction data (harvesting, processing, shipping) is stored on-chain using Solidity Smart Contracts.
* **End-to-End Traceability:** A QR-code based system allowing consumers to trace products back to the specific farm.
* **Tamper-Proof:** Once data is entered onto the blockchain, it cannot be altered, preventing fraud in organic or premium labeling.
* **Hybrid Architecture:** Uses **MongoDB** for heavy media storage (images/logs) and **Ethereum** for critical verification data to optimize gas costs.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Frontend:** React.js, Tailwind CSS
* **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
* **Blockchain:** Solidity, Ethereum (Hardhat/Truffle)
* **Database:** MongoDB, IPFS (for decentralized file storage)
* **Tools:** Metamask, Web3.js

## 🔮 Roadmap for Public Release
- [ ] Push Smart Contract source code (`/contracts`)
- [ ] Upload Frontend React Architecture (`/client`)
- [ ] Add deployment documentation for local testing
- [ ] Add demo screenshots and architectural diagrams
